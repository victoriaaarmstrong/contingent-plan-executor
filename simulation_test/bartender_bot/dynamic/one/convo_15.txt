AGENT: What would you like to drink?
USER:  A wine sounds nice. Can I use cash?
AGENT: Great, tailoring your options based on a wine...
AGENT: Okay, I'll take that into account.
AGENT: What flavour profile do you usually go for (e.g. light, fruity)?
USER:  I normally go for a fruity drink. The five ounce.
AGENT: Would you like a tall or short glass?
USER:  Do you have a short glass? I'd like to pay with cash.
AGENT: Glass preference has been logged.
AGENT: Excellent thanks! I've sent your order for a red wine to the bartender, and you'll pay by cash.
